# Fault-Tolerant-QC

A fault tolerant quantum computer that can implement Grover's algorithm. Grover's algorithm is a solution to unsorted search problems. Where classical computing solutions would take a linear time to solve such problems, Grover's algorithm can find such solutions in approximately root(n) time, representing a quadratic speedup. This quantum computer implements Grover's algorithm, finding and counting the number of solutions to an unsorted set of inputs.
